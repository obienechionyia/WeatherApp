# Python Weather App

This was the first fully functioning command line application I made in Python. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather forecasts in any city or zip code in the world, and display them to the user either in the terminal or through a simple GUI made with tkinter. It also uses geolocation tracking to allow users to retrieve weather info for their current location.
